I have a problem to discuss with you regarding the current development method.
In addition to "Kotlin", mobile app development can be done using "Java", "Flutter", and "React Native".

Previous developer used the "Kotlin" language to develop app that can only work on Android.
Considering the possibility of future scalability, I think it would be better to create an app that works on both Android and iOS at the same time.

If you want to create an app that can work on both Anroid and iOS by using the "Kotlin" language, need to develop  iOS separately for Android and iOS.
This is not effective in terms of development speed, time, or cost.

The best way to overcome these problems is to use "React Native" to develop the app.
Of course, the result is the same as when developing with "Kotlin".
However, if we use "React Native", don't have to develop separately for Android and iOS, and it is much superior in terms of development speed, time, and cost than using "Kotlin".

Therefore, I am planning to use "React Native" to develop the app, and I would appreciate it if you could let me know your opinion on this.
